## Cat Profiler

Cat Profiler is an app that allows you to add and list cats with their name, breed, characteristis, description and weight. It features a minimalist UI and utilizes PullState, a very lightweight and highly optimized state managment library. 

To run the code, simply navigate to clone repository and run `npm install` followed by `npx run expo`.

## Set up your development environment:

If you have any issues following this README, try this resource: https://docs.expo.dev/get-started/create-a-project/

Firstly, Fork this repo

### start development server

Notes on installing the Expo CLI: https://docs.expo.dev/more/expo-cli/

To run:

`npx expo start`

This should create a window like this:

You have 2 options for developing:

- if you have your mobile phone, you can install the Expo Go app and scan the QR code that shows up.
  This is the easiest way to get started fast.
  
- If you want to run on an emulator

   - if on mac, you can either install simulator (ios) or android studio. I recommend simulator:
  the shortcut to launch the app on the simulator after running expo start is : i

   - if on Windows, you must install android studio, open Virtual Device manager, launch an android emulator.
