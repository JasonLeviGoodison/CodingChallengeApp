# CatDex

This is a simple cat pokedex like app, that shows you a list of cats with their name, breed and a description. The app consists of a simple UI to add cats, edit and delete them. It also utilizes React Context for storing state's and uses AsyncStorage to have a local storage of all the cats.

You have 1 week to complete the challenge.

Implementation and design will be evaluated.

### Submit your challenge

Follow these instructions to submit your challenge.

-   Fork this Repository
-   Setup your Development Environment
-   Write your Code
-   Create a PR off of your forked repo
-   Send me the PR so I can review it :)

### Impress us with your skills

Challenge:

Jack owns so many cats that he can't keep track of all of them. He needs some way to keep track of all of his cats - almost like a Pokédex for cats.

### Requirements

Your app should be able to complete the following tasks:

-   Add a new Cat (Name, Breed, Description, or anything else you think would be important)
-   Remove Cats
-   Edit Cats
-   List all of his Cats
-   Persist data using React Contexts or Redux

### Grading

The grading of the app will be based off of three criteria:

-   30% - UI and UX
-   40% - Overall Design and Structure
-   30% - Data Management and Store

## Set up your development environment:

If you have any issues following this README, try this resource: https://docs.expo.dev/get-started/create-a-project/

Firstly, Fork this repo

### start development server

Notes on installing the Expo CLI: https://docs.expo.dev/more/expo-cli/

To run:

`npx expo start`

This should create a window like this:

You have 2 options for developing:

-   if you have your mobile phone, you can install the Expo Go app and scan the QR code that shows up.
    This is the easiest way to get started fast.
-   If you want to run on an emulator

    -   if on mac, you can either install simulator (ios) or android studio. I recommend simulator:
        the shortcut to launch the app on the simulator after running expo start is : i

    -   if on Windows, you must install android studio, open Virtual Device manager, launch an android emulator.
        The shortcut to launch the app on the simulator after running expo start is : i
