## Instructions

### Build your app

You have 1 week to complete the challenge.

Implementation and design will be evaluated.

### Submit your challenge

Follow these instructions to submit your challenge.

- Fork this Repository
- Setup your Development Environment
- Write your Code
- Create a PR off of your forked repo
- Send me the PR so I can review it :)

### Impress us with your skills

Challenge:

Jack owns so many cats that he can't keep track of all of them. He needs some way to keep track of all of his cats - almost like a Pokédex for cats.

### Requirements

Your app should be able to complete the following tasks:

- Add a new Cat (Name, Breed, Description, or anything else you think would be important)
- Remove Cats
- Edit Cats
- List all of his Cats
- Persist data using React Contexts or Redux

### Grading

The grading of the app will be based off of three criteria:

- 30% - UI and UX
- 40% - Overall Design and Structure
- 30% - Data Management and Store

## Set up your development environment:

If you have any issues following this README, try this resource: https://docs.expo.dev/get-started/create-a-project/

Firstly, Fork this repo

### start development server

Notes on installing the Expo CLI: https://docs.expo.dev/more/expo-cli/

To run:

`npx expo start`

This should create a window like this:

<img width="500" alt="Screenshot 2023-05-16 at 10 13 11 AM" src="https://github.com/JasonLeviGoodison/CodingChallengeApp/assets/20760528/e24a44ff-f3b9-4bab-a1e5-ecd02f31ec7a">

You have 2 options for developing:

- if you have your mobile phone, you can install the Expo Go app and scan the QR code that shows up.
  This is the easiest way to get started fast.
- If you want to run on an emulator

  - if on mac, you can either install simulator (ios) or android studio. I recommend simulator:
    the shortcut to launch the app on the simulator after running expo start is : i

  - if on Windows, you must install android studio, open Virtual Device manager, launch an android emulator.
    The shortcut to launch the app on the simulator after running expo start is : i
